Glenfinnin is a must visit!!! The Harry Potter train is fantastic to see!! Ben Nevis visitor centre didn't disappoint, the cable car up to the lookout area and ski cafe was fun. All in all a wonderful holiday in the highlands!! And each night to return to a warm cottage to make dinner and sit in front of the fire was a treat!!!"

The Cottage was cleaned to a high standard and had all the facilities and cooking equipment we needed. We were very happy there and we can't fault it at all. It was the perfect place for us to explore the Highlands with Fort Augustus and Loch Ness only 5 minutes drive away and so many walks exploring the beautiful surroundings a short distance away too. The garden was great for the dogs and was all enclosed so they were quite happy roaming around. Jane is a great host with brilliant communication and made our stay very easy. I'd highly recommend staying at Owl Cottage and we will definitely be back to stay again."
