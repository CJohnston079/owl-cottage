We couldn't fault her communication throughout, from booking right through to the end of our stay.

We would happily highly recommend this cottage to family and friends!"

Nice views across the glen to the front and a bracken covered hill to the back with occassional deer. Back garden is fenced in, so safe to release our little Border Terrier into. We used the location as a base to explore across the highlands, down to Glencoe and the Skyfall road which is a must. Malaig and Skye on the west coast and Loch Ness and the Cairngorms north and east. it's a 4 minute drive up to Fort Augustus where you have a few food options and a well equiped general store at the petrol Station, which had the cheapest fuel out side of Inverness.

Beautiful cottage in a perfect location with lots of walks and sights just a short drive away. Will definitely stay in this cottage again and would recommend to anyone looking to visit the Highlands."

It's about an hour's drive to Inverness, half an hour to Fort William, but thankfully only a few minutes to Fort Augustus which has fuel and a decent shop. There's plenty to do in the local area, in terms of walking and cycling. We went for breakfast at the local Jaggy Thistle caf√© which we'd highly recommend. Simple food, friendly staff, and a lovely dog called Barney!"

Another reviewer commented about not being able to walk from the door, which is true, but there are so many nice walks less than 10 mins drive away that it didn't matter. Nice big bed and super comfy!"
